DEV: plugin for ranger âŒ‡HU+nu

* easily create new tasks by template with new automatic xtref inside
  ?? BUT: we can use task birthtime instead ??
  ALSO: we need UUID anyway, why bother to have both UUID and xtref
    ? different domains and purpose -- tasks exchange .vs. local indexing

* manipulate tasks only
