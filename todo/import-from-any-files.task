IDEA: parse files for /[_] .../ things
  => directly treat them as file-based tasks
    * allow xrefs, blockers and agendas for them
    * directly close these tasks from inside agenda by back-propagation of edits
  => convert them to file/dir based tasks on demand
  + when you allow multiple tasks per file with some surrounding context
    -- there will be no difference if you embed tasks into another syntax \
      or invent for them their own syntax and file mime-type
