Each feature has rigid structure
  * journal
  * src
  * test
  * ...

And task journal also can have rigid structure
  * bugs
  * future
  * ideas
  * next
  * rfc
  * ...

  i.e. you group tasks not solely by types, but more likely by activity you expect to apply to them
  !! of course *feature* itself must be small enough to not accumulate too much very different bugs/etc inside subdir
